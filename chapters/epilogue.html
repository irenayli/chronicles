            <h3>Epilogue: Forward</h3>
            <p>From these stories, I hope you can recognize the immense diversity of the chronic pain experience, as well as the underlying similarities present in many of these stories. The lack of concrete answers; the presumption that it&rsquo;s &ldquo;all in your head&rdquo;; the cost of health care; the dismissal from certain medical providers; the uncertainty of pain that comes and goes; the isolation of having chronic pain while you&rsquo;re young.</p>
            <p>In the &ldquo;less serious&rdquo; cases that call for exercise or ergonomics, personal accountability also emerges as a sticking point. As much as I try to stand up every hour and work on my core exercises, I know that I, perhaps in equal part, work against my interest in preventing my pain as well. As I write this, I find myself sitting in criss-cross-applesauce in my desk chair.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>To accommodate this extremely un-ergonomic position, I&rsquo;ve pulled my lumbar support cushion, the very thing I bought to help with my back pain, around to the back of the chair where it hangs uselessly over the floor. I know full well that this is an act of self-sabotage, that my day-to-day pain management regimen is my individual responsibility. Still, it can be exhausting just to be able to get through the day pain-free; sometimes, it feels easier to just let the pain linger.</p>
            <p>After all, it&rsquo;s not like the pain will go away anytime soon; the only way forward is through.</p>
