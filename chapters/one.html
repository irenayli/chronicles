            <h3>Chapter One: Sleep to Dream</h3>
            <p>Amer is one of my closest friends. We share an exceedingly similar sense of humor, an affinity for portmanteaus, many physical mannerisms, and pain in our middle and lower backs.</p>
            <p>Despite all the time we spend together, few conversations of ours take a serious turn. I was somewhat surprised to learn about his chronic pain; I had complained to him many times about my own, and he had to endure my many requests to switch study spots if the chair I was sitting in had bad lumbar support. It was only after I mentioned having spoken to another friend about his chronic pain that Amer first mentioned his own.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;It's particularly bad when I'm standing for too long or after I wake up from a long sleep,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I would say it started probably when I was around 14 or 15, and it has lasted until today.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>When I asked if the pain onset suddenly or after a catalyzing event, he talked about attending a series of sleepaway camps with disparate bed configurations. Some mattresses were too soft; others too thin; all wrong in their own ways.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;It started only when I was sleeping in places outside of my own bed,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I thought it was originally something like, maybe it's just the wrong kind of mattress. But nowadays, a couple of years later, even when I sleep in my own bed at home, I'll still wake up with that exact same kind of back pain.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>Amer&rsquo;s primary care provider was pretty confident that his symptoms were emblematic of muscle tension. But being able to put a name to the root cause provided little by way of relief, nor options for medical treatment.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;My PCP said it was muscle tension, and there's only so much you can do about that. So if that's the case, and she seems pretty confident, then I didn't see the point in going to a specialist, if they would just tell me the same thing, and there's still going to be not as much to do about it.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>Besides some basic stretches and physical therapy exercises, his doctor also advised him to switch up his mattress and pillow specs, which he tried to no avail.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;I've probably tried every combination of pillow and mattress, and I'm not sure it's made much of a difference, so I've resolved to thinking that maybe I will just deal with it because it's not too obstructive.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>In some ways, our experiences with pain in the exact same area were perfect mirrors of one another. I feel the most relief when laying in my hyper-specific bedding configuration; being at rest is what triggered the pain for him, actively hindering his ability to feel rested.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;I can't get more than six or seven hours of sleep at a time.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>Besides sleep, standing or running for long periods of time are also particularly hard for him; for me, getting up and walking around is crucial for avoiding sitting-induced pain. Running is the only exercise where I do not have to make modifications to accommodate my back.</p>
            <p>Without a clear path for treatment or enhanced symptom management, Amer said, he has long accepted that his pain is just something he will have to live with.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;Unfortunately, it&rsquo;s kind of gotten worse over the years. I know that many older adults struggle with back pain. I think that there are available remedies, which I'm thankful for, but I would have to imagine that as I grow older, I expect my sleep quality to get worse, and I expect the back pain to probably become a little bit more of a problem,&rdquo; he noted. &ldquo;I fully expect it to persist.&rdquo;</p>
