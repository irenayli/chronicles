            <h3>ACKNOLWEDGEMENTS</h3>
            <p>The friends, new and old, who shared their stories for me to chronicle; I can't thank them enough.</p>
            <p>Dr. Chelsea Kaplan, for graciously serving as my consultant on this project and for lending me her expertise.</p>
            <p>Prof. Shelley Manis, for her steadfast kindness and guidance for myself and the rest of my Minor in Writing Capstone cohort.</p>
            <p>The members of my Capstone cohort, for their camaraderie and for the inspiration their writing provides me every day.</p>
            <p>Finally, the friends who wrote senior theses this semester, for the reminder that I could always be doing more.</p>
